# **App Name**: BioScript

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: User authentication system that handles Doctors' registration/login via username/password and Pharmacists' login via biometric scanning.
- Patient Biometrics: Patient identification and registration system using AS608 fingerprint sensor. Patients who do not have any previous records are registered into the system.
- Prescription Management: Doctors create prescriptions, which are associated with the fingerprint ID and written in the prescription table.
- Pharmacy Module: System identifies the patients in the Pharmacy module through biometric scanning and grants access to the prescribed medications.
- AI-powered Assistance: AI tool generates prescription suggestions based on a review of patient information. The tool will use reasoning to decide when or if to incorporate some piece of information in its output.
- Extra Features: Settings for checking fingerprint sensors and managing the app's database server connection are included as an addition.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#1499d3) represents a clean, medical look, contributing to trustworthiness and calm. Sky blue integrates with the brand while maintaining neutrality.
- Background color: Near-white (#F0F8FF) creates a non-distracting backdrop that enhances readability and makes the UI accessible and inviting.
- Accent color: Violet (#A020F0) makes crucial features, alerts, or calls to action stand out in the medical UI. This creates visual equilibrium without sacrificing the intended utility.
- Font Pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers combined with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body, or where longer text is needed, delivers a balance of legibility and design suitable for medical contexts.
- The design employs a full-screen format with logically organized, user-friendly, basic forms to optimize readability and usability, ensuring medical staff may navigate and use the software with minimal work.
- The app includes obvious symbols and prompts that will walk consumers through the process, reducing the learning curve.
- Refined transitions, progress indications, and feedback mechanisms will promote user engagement by making the program user-friendly and responsive. Animated elements must not cause distraction; they are expected to be used as an adjunct for usability, promoting general understanding of system states and enhancing the user experience.
